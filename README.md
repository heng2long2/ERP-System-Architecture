# ERP System Architecture — Demo Interface

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a lightweight front-end module simulating a basic **ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning)** system. It is built with **Bootstrap 5** and **jQuery**, showcasing core CRUD functionalities: **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**.

It serves as a foundational UI component for future integration with APIs, databases, or complete ERP back-end systems.

## 📁 File Structure

```
erp-system/
├── index.html       # Main HTML file with embedded scripts
```

---

## ⚙️ Core Logic

* `$("#element").val()` and `.text()` used for input/output binding.
* `.append()` dynamically injects new `<tr>` elements into the table body.
* `.click()` used to bind dynamic event listeners.
* `.parents("tr")` locates the related row for deletion or editing.
* `.eq(index)` targets specific table cells during row updates.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* ✅ Form validation (e.g., valid email format)
* ✅ AJAX integration with back-end API
* ✅ Persistent data with database connection (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
* ✅ User authentication and role-based access
* ✅ Component refactor using React, Vue, or other modern frameworks

---

## 📸 UI Highlights

* Clean layout with Bootstrap 5 styling
* Responsive table with hover and striped rows
* Modular, extensible script for CRUD operations
